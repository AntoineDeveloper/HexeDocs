# Hexe Docs
Welcome to Hexe's documentation page, If ever you notice a mistake please let me know in my discord server. To add hexe use the website in the description of this repo.

## What Hexe can do
Hexe is a Moderation all the way to entertainement. Hexe can do all kinds of things. It has an economy system to have fun and keep users entertained. It also has very strong moderation systems like as basic like ban, kick, mute, warn but it also has more complex features like blocking links or server invites.

## Security Information
Hexe is a bot that is kept under high security, this is very important for us and we do believe that user security is very important. That is why our bot does not require many permissions. It only requires the perms that it will actually use, it does not require admin perms per example.
